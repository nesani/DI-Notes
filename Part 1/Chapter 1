# Definition of Dependency injection

Dependency injection is set of software design principles and paterns that enables you to develop loosely coupled code.

## How to explain Dependency injection to five year old

When you go and get things out of the refrigerator for yourself, you can cause problems. You might leave door open, you might get
something Mommy and Daddy does't want you to have. You might even be looking for something we don't even have or which has expired.

What you should be doing is stating a need, "I need something to drink at lunch" and then we  will make sure you have something when
you sit down to eat.

What this means in terms of object oriented software development is this: collaborating classes (the five year old) should rely on
infrastructure(the parrents) to provide necessary services

## Purpose of DI
Purpose of DI isn't a goal itsels, its a means to an end. Meaning, creating maintainable code. as quoted in gang of four:
"Program to interface not implementation"

DI is nothing more than tehnique that enables loose coupling

## Common myths about DI

- DI is only relevant for late binding
- DI is only relevant for unit testing
- DI is a sort of Abstract factory on steroids
- DI requires DI container

Although none of these myts are true they are prevalent nonetheless.

### DI is only relevant for late binding
late binding referes to the ability to replace parts of application without recompiling the code, meaning if application supports both
oracle and sql databases, we can change database targeting via configuration.

### DI is only relevant for unit testing
DI helps a lot regarding unit testing, meaning we can easyly substitute services with mock data, but that is not only function of DI
and should not be in mindset that is used "ONLY" for that.

### DI is a sort of Abstract factory on steroids
The most dangerous fallacy is that DI involves some sort of general purpose Abstract Factory that you can use to create instances of
dependancies needed for application.

DI is "NOT" a service locator. it is exact opostive of it. it is a way to structure code so that you never have to imperativly ask for
dependencies, Rather you requre consumers to supply them.
